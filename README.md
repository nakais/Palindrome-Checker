# Palindrome Checker

This Java program checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/palindrome-checker-java.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd palindrome-checker-java
    ```

4. Compile the Java program:

    ```bash
    javac PalindromeChecker.java
    ```

5. Run the program:

    ```bash
    java PalindromeChecker
    ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a string. After entering the string, the program will print whether it's a palindrome or not.

## Testing

You can test the program by entering different strings, including:

- Single-word palindromes (e.g., "level", "radar")
- Phrases or sentences that are palindromes (e.g., "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!")
- Non-palindromic strings (e.g., "java", "hello world")

## Example

```bash
Enter a string: level
The input string "level" is a palindrome.
